## About The Project


In our study, we evaluated the performance of a commercially available AI algorithm (Lunit INSIGHT for CXR, accessible at https://insight.lunit.io) for nodule detection using the publicly available NLST dataset(https://cdas.cancer.gov/nlst/). 

The NLST dataset consists of anonymized DICOM files of screening chest X-rays, cancer diagnosis and survival information, and NLST radiologists' assessment of the chest X-rays. A more detailed overview and study design can be found in the provided Radiology paper (https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.10091808).
